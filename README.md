# Twitter_sentiment_analysis_US_election
Machine learning for twitter sentiment analysis
In this exercise we will be using two data sets containing tweets to predict the sentiments of the tweets. The first data set (sentiment_analysis.csv) contains generic tweets and the second data set (US_Elections_2020.csv) contains tweets pertaining to the US 2020 elections. We will first preprocess the dataset and vectorize the data sets. We will then apply 7 different machine learning algorithms to train and predict the sentiments for the generic tweets data. We will then evaluate the models using the elections data set.

The second part of the exercise involves using three machine learning models to predict the negative reasons of the tweets in the elections data set. The hyperparameters of the three ML models are tuned and the final predictions are discussed.
